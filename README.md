# Vaesen Interactive Character Sheet

## Overview

This is an interactive, browser-based character sheet designed for the Vaesen - Nordic Horror Roleplaying game by Fria Ligan (Free League Publishing). It aims to provide a digital alternative to paper character sheets, allowing players to easily create, manage, and update their Vaesen investigators.

The sheet integrates various rulebook elements for quick reference, automates some calculations, and provides tools for dice rolling and tracking character progression.

## Features

    *   Input and save all core character details: Name, Age, Archetype, Motivation, Trauma, Dark Secret, Memento.
    *   Manage Attributes (Physique, Precision, Logic, Empathy) and Skills.
    *   Track Conditions (Physical and Mental) and Broken states.
    *   Record Resources, Capital, and manage current resource values.

    *   Import and Export character data as JSON files for backup or transfer.
*   **Rulebook Integration**:

## How to Use

1.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2.  **Create/Edit Character**: Fill in the fields on the character sheet. Most changes are saved automatically to your browser's local storage.
3.  **Import/Export**:
    *   Use the "Sheet Actions" > "Export JSON" button to save your character to a file.
    *   Use the "Sheet Actions" > "Import JSON" button to load a previously saved character file.
4.  **Dice Rolling**:
    *   Click the "Roll" button next to an attribute or skill, or the "Use" button for weapons/equipment that trigger rolls.
    *   A modal will appear showing the dice pool calculation. You can add "Other Dice" (e.g., GM modifiers) before rolling.
    *   Optionally, configure a Discord Webhook URL under "Sheet Actions" > "Discord Settings" to send roll results to a Discord channel.
